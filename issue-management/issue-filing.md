# Filing a new issue

## Before filing an issue 

Before you file an issue, please do the following: 

- make sure you are using the development version of the project. 
It's possible that you are not the first person experiencing a particular issue 
so we want to avoid duplicate issues.

- make sure your issue is not already filed. 
Quickly look at tue open issues of the repository or - if there are many
open issues - do a quick keyword search. Filtering the issues 
according to labels might help.

## Actually file an issue 

- use a concise title for your issue that describes the problem.
  Don't categorise the issue with a keyword like "feature request: feature xyz".
  This will be taken care of by the appropriate labelling from a collaborator 
  of the repository.
- create a minimal reproducible example that showcases the offending behaviour.
