# Filing a new issue

## Before filing an issue 

Before you file an issue, please do the following: 

- make sure you are using the development version of the project. 
  It's possible that you are not the first person experiencing a particular issue 
  so we want to avoid duplicate issues.

- make sure your issue is not already filed. Quickly look at the open issues of 
  the repository or - if there are many open issues - do a quick keyword search. 
  Filtering the issues according to labels might help.

## Actually filing an issue 

- use a concise title for your issue that describes the problem.
  Don't categories the issue with a keyword like "feature request: feature xyz".
  This will be taken care of by the appropriate labeling from a collaborator 
  of the repository.
- create a minimal reproducible example (see also 
  [reprex](http://reprex.tidyverse.org)) that showcases the offending behavior.
